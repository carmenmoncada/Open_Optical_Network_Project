## ROADM (Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer)  Development

This project focuses on the development of an ROADM (Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer) switch device. All requirements are defined in each LAB folder, which outlines each step needed to reach the final solution. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the system, including measurements:
- Total network capacity
- Per-link average capacity & GSNR
- Per-link minimum/maximum capacity & GSNR
- Blocking event count

This is the assigned topology.
